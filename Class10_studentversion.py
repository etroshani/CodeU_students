####    HOMEWORK: Build your house!    ####

#   The mayor of your town has asked you to draw a sketch of a house to determine what types of houses he should build in the city!
#   The house can be of any shape or form, be any color, and be any size. However, there are requirements.
#   Requirements:
#   1) The house must have a ROOF(triangular, etc.)
#   2) The house must have a DOOR(rectangle, circle, etc.)
#   3) The house must have AT LEAST 1 WINDOW(circle, square, etc.)

#   STEPS:
#       1) Create your pen
#       2) Set a an outline color and a fill color for each element of your drawing (Ex.: Door)
#       3) Set a starting position when drawing an element
#       4) Draw the element in the MOST efficient way
