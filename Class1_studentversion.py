#Welcome to your 1st class with CODEU!

#   In the 1st class, we are covering these topics:
#       -print()
#       -Defining variables
#       -Mathematical equations and operations: Using Python as a calculator
#       -Strings, Integers, Floats and Booleans
#       -Input


####    FIRST PART    ####


##   1. Your first code!    ##

#   Code 'Hello World' and other possible Strings using print().

#   Defining a variable

##  3. Introduction to Operators, Arithmetic Operations, and Booleans  ## 
# This will be very useful in something called CONDITIONALS and LOOPS. We will cover this in future projects and exercises!

####    SECOND PART    ####

#   In the second part, we'll learn how to use INPUT. This will be the first interactive code you will make!
#   You'll learn how to use INPUT with strings, integers and floats. At the end, you'll code a small exercise where
#   you have to create a list of guests!


##  4. Strings, Integers, Floats and Booleans  ##

# String
strings = "A string is a sequence of characters that is read as ONE element. It can be letters, numbers, symbols, and emojis"

# Integer
integers = 5    # An Integer(int) is a value used to represent real numbers that DO NOT HAVE decimals("numbers after the comma").

# Float
floats = 5.55   # A Float(float) is a value used to represent real numbers that HAVE decimals("numbers after the comma").

#Boolean
Booleans = True    # Boolean statements are statements that evaluate to be true or false.
Booleans = False   # This is often used in functions and conditionals.


####  5. Introduction to INPUT!  ####

# Example 1: Insert your name. This will be a String
"""
INSERT CODE HERE

"""

# Example 2: Multiplying two numbers. This will be a two Strings that we will convert to Integers to make the calculations
"""

###     HOMEWORK   |    Creating an interactive calculator! ###

# Create a calculator that can do additions, substractions and multiplications. Make sure to greet the user.
#       1) Greet the user using INPUT and PRINT()
#       2) Addition: Ask for two numbers using INPUT and print the result of the addition
#       3) Substraction: Ask for two more numbers and print the result of the substraction
#       4) Multiplication: Ask for three more numbers and print the result of the multiplication
#       5) Thank them for using the your Calculator


# Greet the user
