#Welcome to your 2nd CODEU class!

#   In the 2nd class, we are covering these topics:
#       -Input()
#       -Float
#       -Conditionals



####    FIRST PART     ####

##   Concepts that we learned last class:   ## 
#       -print()
#       -Defining variables
#       -Mathematical equations and operations: Using Python as a calculator
#       -Strings, Integers, Floats and Booleans
#       -Input



####    SECOND PART    ####

##     1. Continuation of INPUT     ##

##   Big Exercise: Creating a list of VIP guests using name, age and height  ##
#   You are the host of the annual CodeU birthday bash! You are given the responsibility of creating a small VIP guest list
#   Unfortunately, there can only be 3 VIP guests this year. You must take down each guests NAME, AGE, and HEIGHT(cm) using
#   INPUT() and PRINT(). Each guest needs to be displayed with all his\her attributes using PRINT().

###        HOMEWORK        ###
#   For your birthday party, you have a VIP section. Only 2 people are allowed to TRY to enter. To enter, 
#   they must guess the correct number between 1 and 5 that YOU choose using INPUT().You must take down their 
#   First Names, Last Names, and their guess. 

#   1) Welcome your guests!
#   2) Define a variable with a number between 1 and 5. Use Input()
#   3) You have a VIP section and only 2 people are allowed to TRY to enter.
#   4) You have to take down their FIRST NAMES and their GUESS. 
#   5) If they guess incorrectly, they CAN'T be part of the VIP list. You must let them know they can't be a VIP member.
#   6) If they guess correctly, you must greet them using their name and welcome them to the VIP section.
#   7) Print() a message saying the VIP entrance is closed once all tries are done.
