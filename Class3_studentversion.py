#   In the 3rd class, we are covering these topics:
#       Conditionals: IF, ELIF, ELSE
#       Time Module


####    FIRST PART     ####

##   1) Concepts that we learned last class:   ## 
#       -Input()
#       -Float
#       -Conditionals: IF, ELIF, ELSE

##   2) Homework Revision   ##

####        2) Exercise of the day: JUMANJI        ####
# You have to create your own JUMANJI Adventure. You create a character with a NAME, AGE and WEIGHT using INPUT.
# That character then has to face challenges in the jungle where they are always given 2 choices. Ultimately, one of the
# choices leads to losing the game and the game ends. The other choice leads to the next challenges.
# REQUIREMENTS:
#       -There has to be 3 challenges MINIMUM
#       -There are 2 choices per challenge
#       -Make it creative and FUN!

####    HOMEWORK: Create your own ICE CREAM STORE!    ####

#   You will build an ice-cream store where clients will walk in and be welcomed!
#   1) You must give your store a name
#   2) Customers will then have the choice of Chocolate and Vanilla ice cream.
#   3) They can choose between 3 sizes: Small(s), Medium(m) and Large(l)
#   4) You must let them know their total once they have ordered!
#   Here are the prices:
#   | Vanilla |
#       Small : 2$
#       Medium : 5$
#       Large : 10$ However, it's currently OUT OF STOCK
#   | Chocolate |
#       Small : 3$
#       Medium : 10$ However, they ordered the 100th medium chocolate ice-cream today so they get it for free!
#       Large : 30$
