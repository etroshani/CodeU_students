####    HOMEWORK: Create your Wish List Maker!    ####

#   You will build a Wish List Maker for anyone that would like to make a list of presents they would love to receive in the future!
#   1) You must create an empty list where each gift will be added
#   2) You will then define a variable using INPUT(). This is where the user is asked what present they would like to add to the list.
#   3) The list can contain only 5 items.
#   4) Create a WHILE Loop that ends once the list LENGTH is equal to 5. 
#   5) Print() the completed list to the user

# 1st Part : Create an empty list
"""

"""


# 2nd Part : Create the WHILE Loop that ends once the list LENGTH is 5

# Explanation: The user will be asked to add a present to the list 5 separate times. This means that the same question is
#              repeated 5 times. Each answer is added to the list.

# 3rd Part : Print() the list
