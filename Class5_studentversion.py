####    HOMEWORK: Will the elevator break?    ####

#   A famous hotel in New York City has a faulty and very weak elevator. They've held back on fixing it
#   because they are lazy and don't want to spend money. 
#   By precaution, the can only allow 8 people on the elevator at a time.
#   A group of tourists arrive at the hotel. They all book a room for the night. Since they're all together,
#   they decide to go up at the same time. We have the weight of each person in pounds:
#   208, 200, 350, 500, 127, 145, 134, 900
#   The elevator can only hold a MAXIMUM of 2500 pounds. You must determine if the elevator will break
#   if they all use it at the same time!

#   1) You must create a list with all weights
#   2) You will then define a variable for the total weight.
#   3) You must use a FOR Loop to navigate the list you made
#   4) Add each individual weight to the variable for total weight
#   5) Print() the total weight once the loop is complete
#   6) Print() the number of people on the elevator using a list method
