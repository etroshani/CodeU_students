####    HOMEWORK: Aliens?    ####

#   The CIA is currently investigation a HIGH SECRET case.
#   There is a remote island in the carribeans that they think is very suspicious.
#   Using satellites and radio, they're able to pick up weird and unusual signals.
#   They decide to send in a spy to scout the area and see what's going on.
#   As she explores the island, she spots a weird moving shape from the distance.
#   She gets closer and sees that it's...aliens!
#   As soon as she realizes, she runs away to hide while calling the CIA to let them know.
#   However, as she was running, she dropped the cellphone in a puddle.
#   She was only able to let them know that there are aliens, but not how many there were.
#   She remembered seeing a radio near where the aliens were stationed.
#   So, at night, she decided to infiltrate their camp to use their radio to communicate with the CIA.
#   Unfortunately, she could only communicate using different sequences of binary code (1101, 010, 0011, ...)
#   It's common knowledge at the CIA that all 1's represent an enemy. 

#   It is your duty to decrypt this message and determine how many aliens are present on the island!!

#   Here is the encrypted message received by the CIA
