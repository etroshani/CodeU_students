#Welcome to your 9th CODEU class!


#   In this class, we are covering these topics:
#       - Introduction to the Turtle Module
#       - Turtle Exercisees



####    FIRST PART    ####

##     Introduction to the TURTLE Module     ##

# We must always start our TURTLE programs with import turtle 
# and finish the code with turtle.done() so that the window remains open

####    HOMEWORK: Olympic Rings!    ####

#   The commissioner of the Olympics has asked you to create the Olympic rings using Python!
#   The Olympic rings contain 5 rings of different colors: Blue, Black, Red, Green, and Yellow
#   1) Each ring has a radius of 50
#   2) The distance between each ring is 80

#   STEPS:
#       1) Create 2 pens for the first and second row of rings
#       2) Set the position for the first ring on the first row
#       3) Draw all 3 rings of the first wor
#       4) Set the position for the first ring on the second row
#       5) Draw the last rings


####    HOMEWORK CORRECTION    ####

# Create 2 separate pens for the 2 rows or rings
